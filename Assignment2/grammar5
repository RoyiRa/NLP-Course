# Symbols in the grammar are case-sensitive.
# 
# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)
# 
# This convention just makes grammars more readable to humans.  Thus:
#
#    - When *you* are writing grammars, you should 
#      follow this convention unless you have a good reason not to.  
#
#    - But the  *program* should still work with grammars that don't
#      follow this convention.  So how can the program reliably tell
#      the difference between terminal and nonterminal symbols?  If
#      there is at least one rule for rewriting a symbol, then that
#      symbol is a nonterminal and should be rewritten.

# The basic grammar rules.  Here's what the abbreviations stand for:
#   S = sentence
#   IIT-S = sentence that fits the prefix 'is it true' and ends with a question mark
#   WH-S = an embedded question sentence
#   WH-VERB1 = transitive-verb or transitive-verb-phrase that fits an embedded question setence
#   SBAR = sentence introduced by subordinating conjunction
#   IIT-SBAR = IIT-sentence introduced by subordinating conjunction
#   RELCLAUSE = VP introduced by subordinating conjunction, helps us understand the NP1 that precedes it
#   NP = noun phrase
#   A-NP = actor-noun phrase
#   A-NP1 = actor-noun phrase that starts with a determiner and may be used before RELCLAUSE
#   O-NP = object-noun phrase
#   IIT-NP = NP that fits the prefix 'is it true' and ends with a question mark
#   IIT-A-NP = A-NP that fits the prefix 'is it true' and ends with a question mark
#   IIT-A-NP1 = A-NP1 that fits the prefix 'is it true' and ends with a question mark
#   IIT-O-NP = O-NP that fits the prefix 'is it true' and ends with a question mark
#   NP1 = det-noun phrase
#   IIT-NP1 = NP1 that fits the prefix 'is it true' and ends with a question mark
#   IIT-A-NP1 = A-NP1 that fits the prefix 'is it true' and ends with a question mark
#   NP2 = pronouns and propernouns
#   VP = verb phrase
#   IIT-VP = VP that fits the prefix 'is it true' and ends with a question mark
#   VP0 = intransitive-verb phrase
#   IIT-VP0 = VP0 that fits the prefix 'is it true' and ends with a question mark
#   VP1 = transitive-verb phrase
#   IIT-VP1 = VP1 that fits the prefix 'is it true' and ends with a question mark
#   PP = prepositional phrase
#   IIT-PP = PP that fits the prefix 'is it true' and ends with a question mark
#   Act = actor, a noun that can perform a verb
#   Obj = object, a noun that cannot perform a verb
#   Det = determiner (sometimes called "article")
#   Prep = preposition
#   Adj = adjective
#   A-adj = adjective that fits actors
#   O-adj = adjective that fits objects
#   Rb = adverb
#   Verb0 = intransitive verb
#   Verb1 = transitive verb
#   WH-VERB1 = transitive verb that fits an embedded question
#   Vbg = VBG verb
#   Cc = coordinating Conjunction
#   Prp = personal pronoun
#   Nnp = proper noun, singular
#   Aux = auxiliary

# Vocabulary.  Your program can see that "ate" is a terminal
# symbol because there exists no rule for rewriting it.
# Any symbol that can rewrite as a terminal (or a string of
# terminals, like "chief of staff") is called a "preterminal."  Notice
# that a preterminal is a special kind of nonterminal.
