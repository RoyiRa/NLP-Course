# BIU-NLP-Course
An assignment from the Natural Language Processing course in BIU, taught by Prof. Yoav Goldberg, Prof. Ido Dagan and Prof. Reut Tsarfaty - if you can, I **HIGHLY** recommend signing up for the class.

For the [technical report](https://github.com/RoyiRa/NLP-Course/blob/main/Assignment1/writeup.pdf) 

For our first assignment, we were tasked with implementing and writing a report:

1. Classifying text to PoS and NER
2. Implementing: Greedy-HMM, Viterbi, Feature-based tagger
3. Adopting the Viterbi code to search over the feature-based tagger's score for each tag
4. Handling UNKs, word signatures, and pruning
5. Work under time constraints (e.g., batch predictions to significantly cut down the inference-time)
6. Comparing the different models; when and why some are better than others
7.  Analyzing how and why we extracted the features we did
